# Non-Conforming-Virtual-Element-Methods
As of now, this repository contains the code for linear non-conforming virtual element methods for Poisson equation. The code is based on the paper The nonconforming virtual element method (ESAIM:m2na) by B.A.de Dios et al
and the mVEM MATLAB package by Y Yu.
